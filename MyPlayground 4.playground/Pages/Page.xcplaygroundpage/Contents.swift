/*: Welcome to the recycling educational playground!

 Since I was young, I was taught about the importance of
 taking good care of our planet because of the environmental
 issues that we have been facing. This impacted me in a way
 that as I grew up I also grew habits that are environmental
 friendly. For example, at work, I talked to my boss so the company could start recycling; I donate to non profit environmental organizations; I bought mugs for my friends so they would stop using plastic cups.
 However, in the past few years, I've realized that most
 people did not have the same privilege to have a good
 environmental education as I did.
 
 I believe teaching children about these issues is very
 important so they can also grow life habits that harm less
 the planet. So I decided to create this playground to teach
 kids, in a simplified and interactive way, how to recycle
 and its importance.

 To play the game, you only need to drag each item to the
 right trash bin.

 ## Why recycling is important

 1. **Recycling conserves resources:** It reduces the need for raw materials so that natural habitats can be preserved.
 2. **Recycling saves energy:** Huge amounts of energy are used when making products from raw materials. Recycling requires much less energy and therefore helps to preserve natural resources.
 3. **Recycling reduces pollution:** Harmful gases are released from rubbish. Recycling helps to reduce the pollution caused by waste.
 4. **No space for waste:** Our landfills are filling fast because we keep increasing our ammount of waste.
 5. **Preserve natural resources for future generations**

 Besides them, there are many other reasons why we should recycle.

 ## You can make a big difference

 In Brazil, it is estimated that one person produces more than 2 pounds of trash a day, that makes almost a ton of trash a year.
 It has never been so important to change our habits and to educate the next generation because our lifestyle has been causing a big impact on the planet - e.g. the record levels of air pollution in South Korea; the climate change that can lead various species' extinction etc.
 We need to change our habits and make them more environmental friendly. It is our Earth, thus, our responsibility.

 ## Other ways you can help the environment
 1. **Reducing:** Try to reduce the amount of wasted produced. E.g: Avoid buying things with excess packaging; replace disposable products with reusable ones.
 2. **Reuse:** Think of ways something can be reused. E.g: Donate unwanted furniture, clothes instead of throwing them away.
 3. **Save electricity.**
 4. **Save water.**
